# UML-Handler

uml-handler is a set of perl/bash scripts for user-mode-linux instances start-stop:  

it allows to start (or stop) multiple uml kernels, just providing a few of parameters via cmdline (ip class, hostname prefix, etc...);
then, let it handles all the rest (for example: execute a command over all instances, stop all instances, etc).  
  

It was developed in 2006 for my academic training, and used for some experiment in university laboratories.  
So, it is definitely an old story, not updated since those days, and there are surely better tools (puppets+kvm in primis): however, I disposed all code for any educational or experimental purpose.
